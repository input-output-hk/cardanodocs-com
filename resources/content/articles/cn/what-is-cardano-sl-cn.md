## What is Cardano SL?

Cardano SL (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a cryptographic currency designed
and developed by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/team) in conjunction with the University
of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the University of Connecticut. Cardano
SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper
["Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol"](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#9BKRHCSI)
by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.

You can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoinâ€™s
design flaws. Please read ["What Makes Cardano SL Special?"](https://cardanodocs.com/introduction/#what-makes-cardano-sl-special)
